# NeuralNetwork
This is a neural network that I built in Python for my Advanced Data Structures class. The purpose of the neural network is to predict whether students will be accepted to a college or not. The data input is attached to this repository along with a slideshow presentation that I wrote with a partner that further explains the neural network and our application of it.
